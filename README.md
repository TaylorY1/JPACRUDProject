##JPACRUDProject



####Description
The name of this project is Beer Insider!
This project was a Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) project that allows a user to connect to a database that I created in or to interact with it. When the webpage opens, the user is immediately met with the homepage that allows the user to input a Beer ID to view which beer that is assigned to that beer. You will be shown the beer ID, the beer type, the beer name, the maker of that beer (which is labeled as Brand), the ABV (percentage alcohol) and the rating of that beer. Alternatively, on that page you can choose to add a beer to the list of beers. If you choose that option, you will be shown a form that allows you to enter the details of the beer that you would like. On the beer description page, you will be met with two links below the information from the beer that ask if you would like to Edit the details of this beer or you can choose to Delete the beer. If you choose to edit the beer details, you will be met with a form that contains all of the details from that beer and the user is allowed to change any of those details. The changes will be reflected when the search for that beer ID is searched for. If you choose to delete that beer, you will be asked to enter the ID of the beer you would like to delete.


####Lessons Learned
During this project, I learned many things. Firstly, is that this project showed me how many truly different ways there are to do this project. Secondly, I learned that the nuance of software engineering is vast. I was able to complete the tasks for this project by trying different things and I was able to troubleshoot the problems just by knowing what the error was telling me, or at least telling me where to look. This project also taught me that persistence and allowing yourself to try many different things and using what worked and what didn't work is really how these projects will get done. The biggest lesson I learned from this project was trusting myself with knowing that even if I mess something up in the code, I can go back and correct it.

####Technologies Used
The Technologies I used for this project were Spring Tool Suite, Java, HTML, JSP's, Gradle Tool, the MAMP in order to incorporate our Apache server. I was also able to use MySQLWorkbench to create a table that contained the details of the beer. The incorporation of Spring into our Java programming allowed us to perform tasks much easier and more effectively. The use of Sprint Boot in this project really allowed me to perform the tasks of providing CRUD operations to a user via a webpage.

####What was fun?
What was fun about this project was being able to see all of the uses of Java and everything works together between the application, the webpage and all of the JSP's. Another thing that was fun for me on this project was it really helped me understand how much I have learned over the past 8 weeks. This was probably one of the first projects in the course where I felt like I knew what needed to be done and could just go and do it after mapping out my idea for how I want the application to work. It was also fun to see how I could accurately determine what was and was not working in the code. This allowed me to play around with different ideas to see how they would work and determine which one was the most effective way to get the job done.
